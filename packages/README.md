## Packages
Meteor looks in this directory for unpublished packages, or packages with a newer version number than the most recently published version.

It is good practice to develop packages in a separate directory from this app and symlink to them from here :

###Example :

ln -s /home/yourself/projects/newPackage yourself:newPackage
